# AI-Keyboard

**AI-Keyboard** is a virtual keyboard powered by AI and hand gesture recognition. Users can type by simply making hand gestures in front of a webcam, offering a touchless and intuitive typing experience. This project leverages computer vision and AI algorithms to detect hand movements and translate them into key presses, providing a seamless interaction. **AI-Keyboard** is perfect for accessibility use cases and futuristic user interfaces.

## Features

- **Gesture-based Typing**: Type by moving your hand in front of the webcam.
